# 👻 Spectral Frequency

**Paranormal investigation datapack for Minecraft 1.21.11**

*Detect. Identify. Survive. Contain.*

Something is watching. The veil between worlds is thinning, and the dead are restless. Equip yourself with ghost-hunting tools, gather evidence, identify the entity, and contain it — if you can survive.
